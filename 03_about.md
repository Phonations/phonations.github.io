**Martin Delille** created an R&D lab for two major companies: *Chinkel* and *Dubbing Brothers*. A computer science and electronics graduate, Martin wears two hats at *Phonations*: Lead developer and post-production expert. Between 2006 and 2008, Martin fully redesigned the *Cappella* software to make it more ergonomic and efficient. Despite the updates made by *Chinkel*, Martin’s 2008 version, which is more stable, is still used by the majority of *Cappella* users. Martin speaks French, English, German and Spanish, has attended several dubbing sessions in Germany and Italy as well as in United States and is dedicated to make his product usable and available to the international community.

**Guy Desdames** created the *Orphée* machine in 1988 as a first step to modernize dubbing writing equipment. The machine shrunk the hardware from the size of a piano to the size of a printer. In 1990, he developed the first *NTSC* rythmo band machines for North America (in Toronto and Montreal). In 2006, he received funding to develop a tapeless hybrid machine using digital video files in the dubbing writing process. On top of his engineering feats, he has done just about everything there is to do in the dubbing business, serving as author, actor and dubbing director on different productions. He has also organized and presented numerous industry events to publicize, promote and bring progress to the dubbing industry.

**Grégoire Parcollet** created *Cappella*, the first rythmo band based software in the world for lip-synching specialists and dubbing writers, between 1996 and 1998 and founded *Chinkel*, a dubbing studio using this technology. The economic advantages of digital technology in the dubbing and post-production industry enabled him to penetrate the dubbing market. Winner of the *2001 Talents* competition, sponsored by *Microsoft*, for *Nestor Technologies*, he also created enterprise management software called *CROM*, specifically for audio-visual businesses. He is currently the Managing Director of the *Woods Media Group*, specializing in localization, production and programming services for the global market.

**Thomas Ayoub** is a young developer studying computer science at IUT d’Orsay. At the age of 14 he won the Junior Chess championship in Paris; he is an amateur photographer and an avid rollerblade fan.
