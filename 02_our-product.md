*Right click [here](http://www.phonations.com/wp-content/uploads/The%20Man%20With...%20Bande%20Rythmo%2059,94.mov) if you want to download an HD version of the video for testing purposes.*

Our current product is a dubbing system that uses *rythmo band* technology.
This technology has been used in France and Canada since the 1960’s but has joined the digital world only 10 years ago.
*Rythmo band technology* has always been the most efficient dubbing technology due to its perfect synchronization with the picture.
With the help of the scrolling text, the image and precise and easy audio cues, voice actors can read more lines per hour than with the *ADR* system.

By using the *Sony 9 pin protocol*, a serial cable and a video reference signal, our product synchronizes with audio recording software (*Protools*, *Cubase*, etc.). The image and rythmo band will run, while the audio will be managed in the audio software that also controls the transport actions (play, record, etc.).
The system is very precise and user-friendly.

The rythmo band scrolls at a steady speed under the image. When the text touches the red synchronization bar, this is a sign for the voice actor to start talking. When the text has completely scrolled under the red bar, this cues the voice actor to finish his sentence.

Our product is compatible with *Cappella* and *.DetX* files or you can simply import *MS Word® .DocX* files. More file formats will be supported in near future (*Mosaic*, *VoiceQ*, *DubStudio*, *Synchronos*, *Annotation Edit*, etc.).
